The colouring book consists of\\n    many pages. On each page is a set of numbered dots that are to\\n    be connected with straight line segments according to some\\n    instructions given on the page. Once these line segments are\\n    drawn, the entire page is to be coloured with as many colours\\n    as the young trigonometric artist desires, provided that the\\n    following rule is obeyed: in order to move continuously from a\\n    point anywhere on the page that has been coloured with colour\\n    $c_1$ to another point\\n    that has been coloured with colour $c_2$, where $c_1 \\\\neq c_2$, at least one line\\n    segment must be crossed. The dots have zero area, and the line\\n    segments have zero thickness (and yet, through the magic of\\n    mathematics, they are still visible). Also, none of the dots\\n    touch the outer boundary of the page, and the instructions are\\n    written in a kind of invisible ink that ensures they do not\\n    interfere with the drawing or colouring processes in any way\\n    (and yet are still readable).\\nMTA\\u2019s executives would like to determine how fun the\\n    colouring book is going to be. So for each picture that the\\n    Ministry\\u2019s designers have created, the executives want to know\\n    the maximum number of colours that can be used to colour that\\n    page. They also want to know if the set of instructions that\\n    they are giving to join the dots is valid. An instruction set\\n    is said to be invalid if (a)\\u00a0there exist two line\\n    segments that intersect at a point that is not an endpoint of\\n    both of the line segments, (b)\\u00a0there is a dot that lies on\\n    a line segment but is not one of its endpoints, or\\n    (c)\\u00a0there is a pair of dots that are not connected by some\\n    sequence of line segments.\\n\",\n          \"As everyone knows, immortal porpoises live on the other side\\n    of straight lines and eat live seagulls, although Federal Law\\n    prohibits transporting the gulls to them (but that\\u2019s another\\n    story).\\nThe well-known scientist Leo $O$. Pisa studied immortal porpoises\\n    at great length, and made a number of interesting discoveries.\\n    He found, for example, that a single pair of porpoises brings\\n    forth a pod of $2$ babies\\n    every year, and that it takes a full year for the babies to\\n    mature and start producing pods of their own. Therefore, if you\\n    start with one pair of newborn porpoises, at the end of the 1st\\n    year, you would still have one pair of porpoises (now mature\\n    and ready to procreate). At the end of the second year, you\\n    would have a nice new pod of newborns. But you would also have\\n    a pair of mature adults! Next year, they would have a second\\n    pod of newborns, but their $1^{\\\\text {st}}$ pod would be ready to\\n    start producing pods of their own.\\nEach year, all the porpoises that were around last year are\\n    still there. But in addition, all the porpoises who were around\\n    two years earlier have babies! However, to prevent the world\\n    from being overrun with immortal porpoises, whenever their\\n    numbers reach one billion ($10^{9}$) pairs or more, one billion\\n    of the pairs mysteriously disappear. Strangely enough, some\\n    years the population disappears completely. Even when that\\n    happens, in the next year new pairs miraculously appear. In\\n    fact, for any given year, $Y$, the number of living porpoise\\n    pairs is $\\\\text {fib}(Y) \\\\bmod\\n    10^9$, where $\\\\text\\n    {fib}(Y)$ is the $Y^{\\\\text\\n    {th}}$ value in the well-known Fibonacci sequence.\\nSuppose each picture \\n    represents a pair alive at the end of the year. Then our\\n    year-to-year Porpoise Population chart would look something\\n    like this:\\nYear\\nPair Count\\nPorpoise Pairs Alive\\n1\\n1\\n\\n2\\n1\\n\\n3\\n2\\n\\n4\\n3\\n\\n5\\n5\\n\\n6\\n8\\n\\n7\\n13\\n\\n8\\n21\\n\\n$\\\\vdots $\\n$\\\\vdots $\\n$\\\\vdots $\\n43\\n433494437\\n$\\\\ldots\\n            $\\n44\\n701408733\\n$\\\\ldots\\n            $\\n45\\n134903170\\n$\\\\ldots\\n            $\\n46\\n836311903\\n$\\\\ldots\\n            $\\nYour job is to write a program that determines the number of\\n    immortal porpoise pairs alive at the end of a given number of\\n    years, assuming that you start with a newborn pair at the\\n    beginning of the $1^{\\\\text\\n    {st}}$ year.

In this two-person game, each player is\\n    assigned a colored disc (red or blue) and takes turns dropping\\n    one of their colored discs from the top into a seven-column,\\n    six-row vertically upright game board. The disc will go into\\n    the lowest free row of that column. The objective of the game\\n    is to be the first player to form four discs in a horizontal,\\n    vertical, or diagonal line. The below diagrams show examples of\\n    ways for a player to win:\\n\\n\\nIn this problem, you will not implement the Connect Four\\n    game in its entirety.
